Question 1:
For each of the following programs, I determined whether or not they are valid Java programs
without typing them in. 

Question 2:
Without typing it in and running it, I determined the output of the program 

Question 3:
the package labeled my.players is part of question 3
Question 3 is the main function where the program is tested
inside that package are three classes named soccer players, saxophone players, and MP3 players.
	by using setters and getters and tostring method, it can be tested through question 3 
Then in main method in question3 class it creates and prints instances of the three classes
of players. 

Question 4:
Like question number 3, we use setters and getters and toString 
package labeled bankaccounts and computeruseraccounts and Question 4 is part of question 4.
class Question 4 is the main function where the program is tested.


Question 5:
question 5 is labeled as "TriangleTable" 
int i and j >= 0 allows the pyramid to start from 0-- contains the numbers from i down to 0.
so that there are 10 rows, you have to put i <= 10
the program creates and print tables of size from 1 to 10.
